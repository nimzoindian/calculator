# calculator

The calculator project from The Odin Project! I loosely followed a youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw as I needed some help with where to start and how to go about designing the project from the beginning. Once I got a general idea of how this person was tackling itl I went ahead and added some features like a history, keyboard support, and more operations. I also changed some of the original creator's logic in how numbers are displayed to the screen.
